# ServeLocal

ServeLocal connects students with local volunteer opportunities, making it easy to find, sign up for, and track community service hours in one platform.

## The Problem

Formal volunteering has dropped more than 23% nationally compared to pre-pandemic levels. Students spend hours searching multiple websites and making phone calls just to find a single volunteer opportunity, while nonprofit organizations desperately need volunteers but lack the resources to effectively advertise their needs.

## The Solution

ServeLocal provides a centralized platform where volunteers can discover opportunities that match their interests and availability, while nonprofits can easily post and manage volunteer positions. The app streamlines the entire process from discovery to hour tracking.

## Features

- **Browse Opportunities**: Search and filter volunteer opportunities by category, location, age requirements, and time commitment
- **Calendar Integration**: Automatically sync volunteer commitments with your calendar and receive reminders
- **Hours Tracking**: Automatically log service hours and generate verified reports for school requirements or applications
- **Organization Profiles**: View detailed information about nonprofits including their mission, past projects, and impact
- **User Accounts**: Separate interfaces for volunteers, organizations, and administrators

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Meteor
- **Backend**: Node.js, Meteor
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Styling**: Semantic UI
